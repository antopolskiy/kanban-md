# Product Hunt launch post draft notes

## Task
#99: Write Product Hunt launch post.

## Inputs used

- Included required Product Hunt components:
  - tagline
  - short + full descriptions
  - maker first comment
  - media checklist
  - launch-day checklist with PST scheduling reminder
- Kept copy benefit-led and practical, avoiding hype-heavy wording.

## Output
